            <h2>Matthew 5 3-12</h2>
            <p>
                3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
            </p>
            <p>
                5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
            </p>
            <p>
                7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
            </p>
            <p>
                8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
            </p>
            <p>
                9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
            </p>
            <p>
                10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
            </p>
            <p>
                12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

            <p>
                3 Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                4 And again, blessed are all they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
            </p>
            <p>
                5 And blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                6 And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.
            </p>
            <p>
                7 And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
            </p>
            <p>
                8 And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
            </p>
            <p>
                9 And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
            </p>
            <p>
                10 And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my name’s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                11 And blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake;
            </p>
            <p>
                12 For ye shall have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for great shall be your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.
